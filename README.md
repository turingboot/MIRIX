### Key Features üî•

- **Multi-Agent Memory System:** Six specialized memory components (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, Knowledge Vault) managed by dedicated agents
- **Screen Activity Tracking:** Continuous visual data capture and intelligent consolidation into structured memories  
- **Privacy-First Design:** All long-term data stored locally with user-controlled privacy settings
- **Advanced Search:** PostgreSQL-native BM25 full-text search with vector similarity support
- **Multi-Modal Input:** Text, images, voice, and screen captures processed seamlessly

### Quick Start
**End-Users**: For end-users who want to build your own memory using MIRIX, please checkout the quick installation guide [here](https://docs.mirix.io/getting-started/installation/#quick-installation-dmg).

**Developers**: For users who want to apply our memory system as the backend, please check out our [Backend Usage](https://docs.mirix.io/user-guide/backend-usage/). Basically, you just need to run:
```
git clone git@github.com:Mirix-AI/MIRIX.git
cd MIRIX

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv mirix_env
source mirix_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: mirix_env\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run the following python code:
```python
from mirix.agent import AgentWrapper

# Initialize agent with configuration
agent = AgentWrapper("./mirix/configs/mirix.yaml")

# Send basic text information
agent.send_message(
    message="The moon now has a president.",
    memorizing=True,
    force_absorb_content=True
)
```
For more details, please refer to [Backend Usage](https://docs.mirix.io/user-guide/backend-usage/).

## Python SDK (NEW!) üéâ

We've created a simple Python SDK that makes it incredibly easy to integrate Mirix's memory capabilities into your applications:

### Installation
```bash
pip install mirix
```

### Quick Start with SDK
```python
from mirix import Mirix

# Initialize memory agent (defaults to Google Gemini 2.0 Flash)
memory_agent = Mirix(api_key="your-google-api-key")

# Add memories
memory_agent.add("The moon now has a president")
memory_agent.add("John loves Italian food and is allergic to peanuts")

# Chat with memory context
response = memory_agent.chat("Does the moon have a president?")
print(response)  # "Yes, according to my memory, the moon has a president."

response = memory_agent.chat("What does John like to eat?") 
print(response)  # "John loves Italian food. However, he's allergic to peanuts."
```
